* Hardware overview
    * CPU and memory hierarchy
    * GPGPU
* Compilers & Libraries
    * Available compilers and performance libraries
    * Common compiler options
* Introduction to parallel filesystems
    * Overview of GPFS and Lustre
    * Relative performance characteristics
* Tuning of MPI applications
* Further information on the hardware architecture
    * Sockets, Cores, Caches and NUMA
    * InfiniBand network
* Arithmetic intensity and the roofline model
* Process and thread affinity
